# 🔗 Clone Graph

Python solution for deep copying a connected undirected graph — a BFS/DFS graph traversal problem.

## 🎯 Problem

Given a reference to a node in a connected undirected graph, return a deep copy (clone) of the graph.

## 💡 Approach

- **DFS + HashMap** — O(V+E) time, recursively clone nodes with visited map
- - **BFS + HashMap** — O(V+E) using queue for level-order cloning
